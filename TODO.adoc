== L1C TODOs ==

TO make this library more accessible, the following needs to happen.

. Completely remove dependency on matlab for unit test data. This still exists in the following places
	- l1qc_newton:test_l1qc_newton_1iter: Basically an integration test. Could replace this with a test that starts with a sparse signal with known L1 norm. Maybe use generic transform A, as a matrix.
	- l1qc_linesearch:test_line_search. Not sure what to do with this.
+

. The matlab code should use the builtin jsondecode, not the external library jsonlab. This requires an extra function or lines of code to actually open/read/close the file, because jsondecode only works on the text itself.

. The dct/dct2 should not store their state as local-globals. This limits the user to seting up a single optimization. Rather, the state should be stored, possibly, as an opaqe  field in the struct of function pointers.
. Setup CI
